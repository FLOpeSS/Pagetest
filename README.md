# Pagetest
Creating a page with go

Trying to create a whole backend with GOLANG
For now we have API calls, already has the MIME TYPES for CSS and JS, allowing the load of them with golang.


Clone the repository to have the code in your computer, with:
```
git clone https://github.com/FLOpeSS/Pagetest.git
```
To run the code you first need to build the container with docker:
```
docker build -t pagetest .
```
Now, to run, you need only to type this command:
```
docker run pagetest
```
