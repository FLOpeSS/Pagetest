Creating a page with go

Trying to create a whole backend with GOLANG


    Todo:
        Make a docker container for the project.
        Make a system to consume a relational database(Mysql, POSTGRES).


For now we have API calls, already has the MIME TYPES for CSS and JS, allowing the load of them with golang.
